# Portfolio

I am a data scientist and software engineer developing interdisciplinary, data-driven solutions to tackle real-world challenges. I currently develop computationally efficient tools for weather forecasting, advise the UK Government on national digital infrastructure, and support a health tech startup advancing early detection methods for
chronic kidney disease. My academic background is in mechanical & aeronautical engineering and I hold a PhD in computational combustion aerodynamics.
