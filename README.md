## Welcome to my portfolio

I am a research data scientist and software engineer at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. I develop interdisciplinary, data-driven solutions to tackle real-world challenges. I am currently working on computationally efficient tools for weather forecasting, advising the UK Government on national digital infrastructure, and supporting a health tech startup advancing early detection methods for
chronic kidney disease. My academic background is in mechanical & aeronautical engineering and I hold a PhD in computational combustion aerodynamics.
